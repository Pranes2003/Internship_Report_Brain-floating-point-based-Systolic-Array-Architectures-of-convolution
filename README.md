# Internship_Report_Brain-floating-point-based-Systolic-Array-Architectures-of-convolution
Worked on the Research Intern titled ‘Brain floating point based Systolic Array Architectures of 
convolution’ in collaboration with Dr G.L. Laksmi Narayanan of the Electronics and Communication 
department of NIT Trichy.
Designed Processing Elements(PE) and different types of architecture for Convolution using a matrix 
multiplication method and compared their power consumption, time analysis, and gate-level 
schematic representation to find the performance level of architecture.
